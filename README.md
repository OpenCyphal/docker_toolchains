![OpenCyphal](opencyphal_logo.svg) OpenCyphal Containerized Toolchains
===================

This repository contains the Dockerfiles, instructions, and some utilities for building containers to be used as common
toolchains for OpenCyphal projects. These containers are published to the
[opencyphal organization on Github](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCyphal/packages) and are used by the build automation
for OpenCyphal projects. You can use these same containers to get consistent build results in your local development
environment.
