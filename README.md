![UAVCAN](uavcan_logo.svg) UAVCAN Containerized Toolchains
===================

This repository contains the Dockerfiles, instructions, and some utilities for building containers to be used as common toolchains for the UAVCAN project. These containers are published to the [uavcan organization on Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/uavcan) and are used by the build automation for UAVCAN projects. You can use these same containers to get consistent build results in your local development environment.
